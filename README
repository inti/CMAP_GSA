* Description
    This program allows to perform gene-set analyses with the results of the Connectivity Map project. Please see the CMAP
project website for details of its nature www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/.

* Details
User must provide a file with a list of genes and a associated tag (e.g., genes associated with a disease). 
    The program will:
    - rank drugs based on the differential expression of these genes compared with all other tested. 
    - rank diseases based on known drugs used to treat them, i.e. disease whose drugs affect the expression of the input
      genes.
    - Similarly to rank disease it will provide a rank of mechanisms of known action for the drugs.
These ranks can either be calculated as a test of differential expression (one sided or two sided test) or as Area Under
the Curve (AUC) value. AUC values have the advantage of providing natural measure of how well the expression profile of 
the input genes classify diseases and drugs machanisms of action. Test of differential expression are probably more
suited is the objective of the analysis is to rank drugs.
We provide a drug-to-disease and drug-to-mechanism_of_action mapping based on the Clinical Trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) and the MeSH
annotations (www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/). However, used can provide additional mapping for the drugs identifiers, e.g., diseases classes like 
nerveous system or immune-disease, main target tissue or associated side effects.

* Program dependencies
In order to run the program you will need R (www.r-project.org) and the following R packages:
- plyr
- ggplot2
- pROC

* TODO
- add PAGE analysis to script
- add FDR control
- add files with mechanism of action
- Write examples
